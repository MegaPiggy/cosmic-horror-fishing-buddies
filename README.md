# Comic Horror Fishing Buddies
A multiplayer mod for DREDGE

Huge thanks to JohnCorby for helping me set up Mirror with the mod. And shout-out to \_nebula and everyone who's contributed to [Quantum Space Buddies](https://github.com/misternebula/quantum-space-buddies), for the inspiration and code that I stole.

## Features (spoilers)

  - Fast forwarding - all players must be fast-forwarding too or at least in port for time to speed up
- Fishing spots
  - Stock is synced but "special" status isn't currently
- Abilities
  - Light
  - Foghorn
  - Manifest
  - Banish (has effects but only works locally)
  - Atrophy
  - Haste (missing vfx)
  - Trawl net
  - Bait
  - Crab pots (inventory not yet synced)
- Ship appearance
  - Rigidbody boat assets (net, tires) don't animate yet
