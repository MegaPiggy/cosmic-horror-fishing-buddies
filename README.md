# Comic Horror Fishing Buddies
A multiplayer mod for DREDGE

Huge thanks to JohnCorby for helping me set up Mirror with the mod. And shout-out to _nebula and everyone who's contributed to Quantum Space Buddies, for the inspiration and code that I stole.

- Fishing 
  - Regular spots (not bait/crab pots)
- Abilities
  - Light
  - Foghorn
  - Manifest
  - Banish (has effects but only works locally)
